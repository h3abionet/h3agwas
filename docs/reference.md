noncompliance
: the failure to observe the requirements of an experimental protocol.

: a group of people with a common characteristic or experience.

fixed cohort
: a [cohort](#cohort) formed on the basis of an irrevocable event such as undergoing a medical procedure.

closed cohort
: a [fixed cohort](#fixed-cohort) in which there is no loss to follow-up.

## Common measures of disease frequency
There are many measures of disease frequency that are commonly used in the public health disciplines. Some are incidence measures, some are prevalence measures, some are ratios. Descriptions and examples of the major measures follow. Note that the word rate is often used incorrectly
to describe a proportion or ratio. 

- **Crude mortality (or death) rate**: Total number of deaths from all causes per 100,000 population per year. The term crude means that the
rate is based on raw data. In 2015 the crude mortality rate in the United States was 844.0/100,000 population/year.
- **Cause-specific mortality rate**: Number of deaths from a specific cause per 100,000 population per year. In 2015, the cause-specific mortality rate from heart disease in the United States was 197.2/100,000/year.
- **Age-specific mortality rate**: Total number of deaths from all causes among individuals in a specific age category per 100,000 population
per year in the age category. In 2015, the age-specific death rate was 589.6/100,000/year among U.S. children under the age of 1 year.
- **Years of potential life lost**: The number of years that an individual was expected to live beyond his or her death. In 2015, a total of 957 years were lost from heart disease, 1,283 years were lost from cancer, and 1,172 were lost from unintentional injuries before age 75 per 100,000 population younger than 75 years of age in the United States. 18 The number of years of potential life lost reflects both the number of individuals who died of a particular cause and the age at which the death occurred. For example, a cause of death that is more common among children and young adults (such as unintentional injuries) will result in more years of life lost per individual than a cause of death that is common among the elderly (such as heart disease).
- **Livebirth rate**: Total number of livebirths per 1,000 population per year. A livebirth is a pregnancy that results in a child who, after separation, breathes or shows any other evidence of life. Sometimes, the denominator includes only women of childbearing age. In 2015, the crude livebirth rate among women who were residents of the United States was 12.4/1,000/year.
- **Infant mortality rate**: Number of deaths of infants less than 1 year of age per 1,000 livebirths per year. This statistic is often divided into neonatal deaths (those occurring during the first 27 days following birth) and post neonatal deaths (those occurring from 28 days through 12 months). In 2014, the infant mortality rate in the United States was 5.8/1,000 livebirths/year, the neonatal mortality rate was 3.9/1,000 livebirths/year, and the post neonatal death rate was 1.9/1,000 livebirths/year.
- **Birth defect rate (also called congenital anomaly or malformation rate)**: Number of children born with defects, usually per 10,000 births. The numerator and denominator often include both livebirths and stillbirths. In 2016–2017, the prevalence of brain malformations, including microcephaly, was 5% among women with evidence of recent possible Zika virus infection.
- **Morbidity rate**: Number of existing or new cases of a particular disease or condition per 100 population. The time period that is covered
and the population size in the denominator vary. Morbidity is a general word that can apply to a disease, condition, or event. For example, from
2011 to 2014, the prevalence of physician-diagnosed diabetes among U.S. adults aged 65 years and over was 20.6%.
- **Attack rate**: Number of new cases of disease that develop (usually during a defined and short time period) per the number in a healthy population at risk at the start of the period. This cumulative incidence measure is usually reserved for infectious disease outbreaks. For example, the 24-hour attack rate for food poisoning was 50% among people who ate chicken salad at the banquet.
- **Case fatality rate**: Number of deaths per number of cases of disease. Note that this measure is a type of cumulative incidence and therefore it is necessary to specify the length of time to which it applies. For example, in 2014 in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the 5-month case fatality rate among individuals with Ebola virus disease was 74.2%. 
- **Survival rate**: Number of living cases per number of cases of disease. This rate is the complement of the case fatality rate and is also a cumulative incidence measure. Five-year relative survival rates for cancer compare people with a particular cancer to similar people in the general population. For example, from 2007 to 2013, 5-year relative survival rates for prostate cancer were 100% among men diagnosed while the tumour was still confined to the prostate or had spread only to the regional lymph nodes and 29.8% among men whose tumour had metastasized to distant sites.
